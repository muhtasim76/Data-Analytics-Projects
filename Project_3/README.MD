Excel Project : Revenue, Cost, and EBIT analysis

In this project,I analyzed the financial data of a water desalination company called Southern Water Corp. I compared revenue, operatinal cost, and EBIT of thier three desalination unit to figure out which unit is the most profitable. First, I analyzed revenue, cost and EBIT at a macro level(i.e. three desalination units being aggregated together). Later, I examined three units individually, at a micro level to pick up revenue, cost, EBIT trends. That will help the company optimize their profit.
