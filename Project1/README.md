In this project, I worked with a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset that contains fundamental 
financial data for 500 companies. I used use spreadsheets to analyze and summarize the data using 
statistics and data visualizations. I also also designed a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income 
statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within Excel. Then I created a forecast financial metrics within the income statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions 
for a company from the NYSE dataset.
